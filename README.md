SignalR: Practical Introduction in ASP.NET Core

Hi Friends, this is Bharath. Today we are going to talk about SignalR.

SignalR is a free opensource library that enables server code to send asynchronous notifications to client in ASP.NET application. It can be used to add any sort of "real-time" functionality to the app. If browser supports, a full duplex WebSocket connection is established via HTTP, if not, the client and server negotiate either server sent events, ajax long polling or forever frame. Let's say you have opened twitter in any modern browser and posted something interesting which your followers love and started pushing like button, you without having to refresh page will see the like count increase magically. Under the hood a WebSocket connection is established and all the likes which reaches the server is pushed to the client, which is you. SignalR Hub API enables you to call methods on connected clients from server in .NET application. We will see that in action by creating a chat app where messages move between clients in real-time. In Part2 we will discuss more features in signalR like Groups, HubContext, Authentication, Hosting and how message queues help in delivery. Usually for these types of pub/sub use cases it is better to use Redis to distribute message for scalability or you can consider using Azure SignalR service. Now, letâ€™s see SignalR in action, lets jump right in.
